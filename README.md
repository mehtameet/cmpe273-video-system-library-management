=======================================

• Scalable, interactive, 3-tier video library management system as a web service capable of renting millions of  movies to its thousands of users.
•	Developed server-side web services (Service oriented architecture) methods and its performance is tested with Jmeter.
•	Efficiency of transaction was increased by implementing prepared statements, Caching(using Hashmap) SQL tuning and connection pooling.
•	Deployed on Google Cloud Engine (http://videosystem273.appspot.com) but its operations are limited as Google Engine did not supports web services. Hence looking other ways to deploy.
